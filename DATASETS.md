# Mycobacterium haemophilum test dataset

Download and uncompress it, and move the directory named `auto-pss-genome-m-haemophylum`, where you will find: (1) a directory called `auto-pss-genome-project`, that contains the structure described in the README; and (2) a file called `run.sh`, that contains the commands to test the pipeline (you should adapt the `AUTO_PSS_GENOME_PD` path).
